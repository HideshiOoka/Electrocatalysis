# Electrocatalysis
## Objective
The aim of this repository is to create a one-stop resource for people interested in microkinetics of electrocatalytic reactions. Topics which will be covered will include 
- Modules for simulating voltammograms.
- Modules for fitting voltammograms to experimental data (CVs) to obtain parameters such as rate constants.
- Mathematical details on the derivations of the microkinetic equations.
