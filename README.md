# Electrocatalysis
## Objective
The aim of this repository is to create a one-stop resource for people interested in microkinetics of electrocatalytic reactions. Topics which will be covered will include 
- Python modules for 
  - Simulating voltammograms.
  - Obtain parameters such as rate constants by fitting experimental voltammograms to experimental data (CVs).
- Mathematical details on the derivations of the microkinetic equations.
  - Comparison between different equations in the literature (Please send me a notification (or pull request) if your equation is not listed and I will add it).
